If an algorithm were to rely on these estimates without accounting for uncertainty, these communities could be misclassified and potentially receive less funding or outreach than they need. Higher uncertainty is often linked to small population sizes, lower survey response rates, and greater variability in economic condition, all of which are more common in sparsely populated rural areas."

DeSoto, a large suburban county, has a very low MOE(3.2%), meaning its income estimate is highly reliable. Alcorn falls into the moderate range with an MOE of 8.7%, while Adams has much higher MOE(12.5%),indicating lower confidence. This comparison highlights how smaller or more rural counties like Adams may be poorly represented in survey data, which could affect the fairness of algorithmic decisions that rely on these estimates."

    "text": "5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\nYour Task: Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\nExecutive Summary Requirements: 1. Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\n\nOverall Pattern Identification\nOur analysis of Mississippi’s county, and tract-level ACS data reveals systematic differences in data reliability across the state. Larger, more urbanized, and higher-income counties such as DeSoto, Jackson, and Madison consistently show low margins of error (MOE &lt; 5%), making them suitable for algorithmic decision-making. In contrast, smaller, rural, and economically disadvantaged counties—such as Adams, Carroll, Sharkey, and Wilkinson exhibit much higher MOEs, often exceeding 10–20%. These patterns highlight a divide between counties where survey data is robust and those where uncertainty limits the safe use of algorithmic systems.\n\n\nEquity Assessment\nCommunities at the greatest risk of algorithmic bias are those with both high demographic diversity and weaker survey reliability. Rural Black-majority counties such as Adams, or counties with small Hispanic populations, often display elevated MOEs. If algorithms rely on these estimates without adjustment, they risk systematically underrepresenting marginalized groups and misallocating resources away from the very populations most in need of support. By contrast, suburban counties with stable data will receive more consistent outcomes, reinforcing existing inequities between regions.\n\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\nThe root causes of these disparities lie in structural differences in population size, socioeconomic context, and geographic accessibility. Smaller populations with smaller ACS sample sizes, amplifying statistical uncertainty. Rural areas often face higher survey nonresponse rates and logistical barriers that further reduce data precision. At the demographic level, minority populations within smaller tracts tend to have particularly high MOEs, not because their needs are less, but because the survey infrastructure is less effective at capturing their experiences.\n\n\nStrategic Recommendations\nTo address these challenges, the Department should implement a tiered algorithmic framework. For counties with high-confidence data, algorithmic allocation can proceed with minimal oversight. For counties with moderate confidence, algorithms should be deployed but coupled with regular audits and feedback loops to monitor performance. For low-confidence counties, algorithmic reliance should be minimized, with decisions supplemented by local administrative data, targeted surveys, and manual review by policy experts. Beyond the immediate framework, the Department should invest in improving data infrastructure expanding local survey capacity, partnering with community organizations, and ensuring demographic groups with historically unreliable estimates are better represented."

Examples include DeSoto, Harrison, Jackson, Lamar, Lowndes, Madison, Monroe, Rankin, and Warren. These counties generally have larger or more affluent populations, which improves ACS survey precision. Algorithms can be implemented directly in these counties with minimal risk.\n\nCounties requiring additional oversight:\n\nThese are Moderate Confidence counties (MOE 5–10%). Examples include Alcorn (8.7%), Benton (7.8%), Forrest (5.6%), Lee (5.4%), Pike (5.7%) and many others across Mississippi. While the ACS data is usable, there is enough uncertainty that algorithmic decisions could introduce bias or misallocation if left unchecked. Recommendation: Algorithms may be applied here, but outcomes should be monitored carefully. Suggested oversight strategies include:\n\nConducting periodic audits of funding allocations.\nComparing algorithmic outputs with administrative or programmatic data.\nImplementing feedback loops from local service providers to catch anomalies.\n\n\nCounties needing alternative approaches:\n\nThese are Low Confidence counties (MOE &gt; 10%), such as Adams (12.5%), Covington (14.3%), Sharkey (24.9%), Wilkinson (23.6%), Carroll (34.5%) and many others. These counties tend to be smaller, more rural, or economically disadvantaged, which leads to higher survey uncertainty. Relying purely on ACS estimates here risks misidentifying need and exacerbating inequities. Recommendation: Algorithms should not be the sole basis for decision-making in these counties. Alternative approaches include:\n\nSupplementing ACS data with local administrative records (e.g., school enrollment, SNAP participation).\nCommissioning targeted surveys to improve reliability.\nUsing manual review and qualitative input from local stakeholders to guide funding decisions."

[We defined low-income tracts as those with a median household income below $72,943.5, which is the statewide median income across all Pennsylvania census tracts. This threshold was chosen because the median reflects the central tendency of income distribution and aligns with a relative, within-state definition of economic disadvantage.] - What elderly population threshold did you choose and why? [We defined elderly-heavy tracts as those with more than 23.5% of residents aged 65 and older, corresponding to the 75th percentile of the elderly population distribution. This threshold identifies tracts where the elderly population is significantly higher than typical statewide levels, focusing attention on areas with concentrated aging populations.] - How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria? [422 tracts meet both criteria (low income and high elderly population).] - What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition? [Out of 3,445 tracts statewide, about 12.2% (422 / 3,445 × 100) are classified as vulnerable under our definition.] —\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\nYour Task:\n\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n\ntarget_crs &lt;- 5070\n\nvulnerable_p &lt;- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, target_crs)\nhospitals_p  &lt;- st_transform(hospitals,        target_crs)\n\nvul_centroids &lt;- st_centroid(vulnerable_p)\n\nnearest_idx &lt;- st_nearest_feature(vul_centroids, hospitals_p)\nnearest_dist_m &lt;- st_distance(vul_centroids, hospitals_p[nearest_idx, ], by_element = TRUE)\n\ndist_miles &lt;- set_units(nearest_dist_m, \"mi\")\ndist_miles_num &lt;- as.numeric(dist_miles)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nvulnerable_with_dist &lt;- vulnerable_p %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    nearest_hosp_id = nearest_idx,\n    dist_miles = dist_miles_num\n  )\n\nsummary(vulnerable_with_dist$dist_km)\n\nLength  Class   Mode \n     0   NULL   NULL \n\nn_far_over_15mi &lt;- sum(vulnerable_with_dist$dist_miles &gt; 15, na.rm = TRUE)\n\ntop_farthest &lt;- vulnerable_with_dist %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(dist_miles)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(GEOID, total_pop, medhhinc, pct65, dist_miles) %&gt;%\n  head(10)\n\ncat(\"\\nVulnerable tracts:\", nrow(vulnerable_with_dist),\n    \"\\nNumber &gt; 15 miles from nearest hospital:\", n_far_over_15mi, \"\\n\")\n\n\nVulnerable tracts: 422 \nNumber &gt; 15 miles from nearest hospital: 25 \n\ntop_farthest\n\nSimple feature collection with 10 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 1427375 ymin: 2043196 xmax: 1754030 ymax: 2243700\nProjected CRS: NAD83 / Conus Albers\n         GEOID total_pop medhhinc    pct65 dist_miles\n1  42103950104      2805    66576 32.08556   28.98276\n2  42113960102      2005    59100 25.98504   27.76385\n3  42033330700      2103    55969 23.58535   25.64808\n4  42097082300      4953    72733 23.64224   20.13255\n5  42083420800      3682    72564 24.38892   20.10985\n6  42113960201      1672    66379 31.81818   19.96396\n7  42043025300      4009    57260 27.16388   19.31860\n8  42023960200      2470    58633 33.03644   19.31279\n9  42119090201      1898    67546 25.50053   18.84035\n10 42061951200      4531    59528 26.04282   18.67494\n                         geometry\n1  MULTIPOLYGON (((1744270 224...\n2  MULTIPOLYGON (((1604264 222...\n3  MULTIPOLYGON (((1456442 214...\n4  MULTIPOLYGON (((1587383 211...\n5  MULTIPOLYGON (((1427375 222...\n6  MULTIPOLYGON (((1576880 222...\n7  MULTIPOLYGON (((1585131 210...\n8  MULTIPOLYGON (((1447968 219...\n9  MULTIPOLYGON (((1548439 213...\n10 MULTIPOLYGON (((1504805 204...\n\n\nRequirements: - Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania - Calculate distances in miles - Explain why you chose your projection\nQuestions to answer: - What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n\nmean(vulnerable_with_dist$dist_miles, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 5.858657\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum distance?

[Sullivan County, Cameron County, Forest County, Clearfield County, Pike County] - Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals? [Huntingdon County, Union County, Dauphin County, Clearfield County, Pike County] - Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located? [Yes. Underserved counties are clustered in rural and mountainous regions of northern and western Pennsylvania, such as Sullivan, Cameron, Forest, and Clearfield Counties. These areas tend to have low population density and aging populations but few medical facilities, reflecting a classic rural accessibility gap. In contrast, eastern metropolitan counties around Philadelphia and the Harrisburg corridor have dense hospital networks and shorter average distances to care.] —\n\n\nStep 7: Create Summary Table\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\nYour Task:\n\n# Create and format priority counties table\n\npriority_table &lt;- counties_summary %&gt;%\n  sf::st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(\n    COUNTY_NAM, county_fips5, n_vulnerable, n_underserved,\n    pct_underserved, mean_dist_miles, vuln_pop_65\n  ) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    priority_score = vuln_pop_65 * (pct_underserved / 100)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(priority_score)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::transmute(\n    County = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Vulnerable Tracts`   = n_vulnerable,\n    `Underserved Tracts`  = n_underserved,\n    `% Underserved`       = paste0(round(pct_underserved %||% 0, 1), \"%\"),\n    `Avg Distance (mi)`   = round(mean_dist_miles, 1),\n    `Vulnerable Pop (65+)`= scales::comma(round(vuln_pop_65)),\n    `Priority Score`      = scales::comma(round(priority_score))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  head(10)\n\nknitr::kable(\n  priority_table,\n  caption = \"Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment in Pennsylvania\",\n  align = \"lcccccc\"\n)\n\n\nTop 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty\nVulnerable Tracts\nUnderserved Tracts\n% Underserved\nAvg Distance (mi)\nVulnerable Pop (65+)\nPriority Score\n\n\n\n\nCLEARFIELD\n4\n3\n75%\n14.7\n3,384\n2,538\n\n\nPIKE\n5\n3\n60%\n17.8\n2,815\n1,689\n\n\nHUNTINGDON\n6\n2\n33.3%\n13.5\n4,185\n1,395\n\n\nSULLIVAN\n3\n3\n100%\n21.5\n1,379\n1,379\n\n\nLANCASTER\n5\n1\n20%\n9.1\n6,691\n1,338\n\n\nCAMERON\n2\n2\n100%\n18.9\n1,320\n1,320\n\n\nBRADFORD\n2\n1\n50%\n14.0\n2,413\n1,206\n\n\nUNION\n3\n1\n33.3%\n8.0\n3,565\n1,188\n\n\nDAUPHIN\n3\n1\n33.3%\n10.7\n3,181\n1,060\n\n\nMCKEAN\n5\n1\n20%\n11.1\n4,449\n890\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements: - Use knitr::kable() or similar for formatting - Include descriptive column names - Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.) - Add an informative caption - Sort by priority (you decide the metric)"

By analyzing the spatial relationship between parks and recreation sites and census tract median income, this study aims to identify whether environmental and recreational resources are disproportionately concentrated in wealthier neighborhoods which is an important issue for urban equity and public health planning. —\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+): - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\nYour Task:\n\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n\n# Your spatial analysis\n\nphilly_tracts &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state     = \"PA\",\n  county    = \"Philadelphia\",\n  variables = c(total_pop = \"B01003_001\", medhhinc = \"B19013_001\"),\n  geometry  = TRUE,\n  output    = \"wide\",\n  year      = 2023,    \n  survey    = \"acs5\"\n) %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    GEOID,\n    total_pop = total_popE,\n    medhhinc  = medhhincE,\n    geometry\n  )\n\ntarget_crs &lt;- 5070  \n\nparks_5070  &lt;- st_transform(parks,         target_crs)\ntracts_5070 &lt;- st_transform(philly_tracts, target_crs)\n\nparks_buf &lt;- st_buffer(parks_5070, dist = 800)\ntract_cent &lt;- st_centroid(tracts_5070)\n\ntract_access &lt;- tract_cent %&gt;%\n  mutate(has_park_access = lengths(st_intersects(., parks_buf)) &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  \n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  select(GEOID, has_park_access)\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_access, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nparks_in_tract &lt;- st_join(tracts_5070, parks_5070, join = st_contains) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  count(GEOID, name = \"n_parks\")\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  left_join(parks_in_tract, by = \"GEOID\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(n_parks = ifelse(is.na(n_parks), 0L, n_parks))\n\ncity_median_income &lt;- median(tracts_5070$medhhinc, na.rm = TRUE)\n\ntracts_5070 &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  mutate(income_group = ifelse(medhhinc &lt; city_median_income, \"Low income\", \"High income\"))\n\naccess_summary &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(income_group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n_tracts     = n(),\n    access_rate  = mean(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_parks   = mean(n_parks, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\naccess_summary\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  income_group n_tracts access_rate mean_parks\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 High income       191       0.717       1.06\n2 Low income        190       0.847       1.07\n3 &lt;NA&gt;               27       0.370       1.15\n\ncitywide &lt;- tracts_5070 %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    tracts_with_access    = sum(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tracts_without_access = sum(!has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE),\n    access_rate_city      = mean(has_park_access, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\ncitywide\n\n  tracts_with_access tracts_without_access access_rate_city\n1                308                   100         0.754902\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tracts_5070, fill = \"grey92\", color = NA) +\n  geom_sf(data = parks_buf, fill = \"#A7C957\", color = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = tracts_5070 %&gt;% filter(income_group == \"Low income\", !has_park_access),\n    fill = \"#D55E00\", color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.15, alpha = 0.9\n  ) +\n \n  geom_sf(data = parks_5070, color = \"darkgreen\", size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Green Space Equity in Philadelphia\",\n    subtitle = \"Low-income census tracts without a park within 0.5 mile (buffers shown in green)\",\n    caption = \"Sources: OpenDataPhilly (PPR Program Sites), 2019–2023 ACS (tidycensus); distances in EPSG:5070\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey20\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis requirements: - Clear code comments explaining each step - Appropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At least one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\nYour interpretation:\n[Using a 0.5-mile buffer as a walkable access threshold, low-income tracts exhibit a lower park access rate than high-income tracts, and they also tend to have fewer parks per tract on average. The map highlights clusters of low-income tracts without nearby parks, pointing to potential recreational access gaps. These findings suggest that future park investments and programming should prioritize underserved low-income neighborhoods to improve equitable access to green space and related health benefits.]"
