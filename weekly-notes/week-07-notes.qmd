## Key Concepts Learned

When use tigris or tidycensus functions, they show download progress by default.

*Model Errors*

Random errors(good)

- No systematic pattern
- Scattered across space
- Prediction equally good everywhere
- Model captures key relationships

Clustered errors(bad)

- Spatial pattern visible
- Under/over-predict in areas
- Model misses something about location
- Need more spatial features

*Defining "Neighbors"*

Contiguity

- Polygons that shares a border
- Queen vs. Rook

Distance

- All within X meters
- Fixed threshold

k-Nearest

- Closest k points
- Adaptive distance

*Moran's I*

If moran's high (errors clustered)

1. Add more spatial features

- Try different buffer sizes
- Include more amenities/disamenities
- Create neighborhood-specific variables

2. Try spatial fixed effects

- Neighborhood dummies
- Grid cell dummies

3. Consider spatial regression models

- Spatial lag model
- Spatial error model


## Coding Techniques

Create the spatial lag of error scatter plot
