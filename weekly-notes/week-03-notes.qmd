## Key Concepts Learned
Quartet: Datasets with identical summary statistics, but completely different patterns when visualized.

### The policy Implications
why it matters
- Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
- Outliers may represent important communities
- Relationships aren’t always linear
- Visual inspection reveals data quality issues

### Bad Visualizations Consequences
Common problems in government data presentation:
- Misleading scales or axes
- Cherry-picked time periods
- Hidden or ignored uncertainty
- Missing context about data reliability

The smaller your sample size is, the larger your margin of error would be

## Grammar of Graphics
### The ggplot2 Philosophy
principles: Data-Aesthetics-Geometries-Visual
Data: Your data set (census data, survey responses, etc.)"I would like to make a plot"
coding:g-ggplot(data=your_data)

Aesthetics: What variables map to visual properties (x, y, color, size) how to draw a connection to specific element in our plot
coding: aes(x=variable 1,y=variable 2)
x, y - position
color - point/line color
fill - area fill color
size - point/line size
shape - point shape
alpha - transparency

Geometries: How to display the data (points, bars, lines)
coding:geom_something()

Additional layers: Scales, themes, facets, annotations
coding:additional_layers()
BUILD PLOTS BY ADDING LAYERS WITH +

#### Understand your data before making decisions or building models
- What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values)
- What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends)
- What’s unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality issues)
- What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation)
- How reliable is this data

#### Enhanced process for policy analysis
1. Load and inspect - dimensions, variable types, missing data
2. Assess reliability - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation
3. Visualize distributions - histograms, boxplots for each variable
4. Explore relationships - scatter plots, correlations
5. Identify patterns - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns
6. Question anomalies - investigate outliers and unusual patterns
7. Document limitations - prepare honest communication about data quality


## Questions & Answers
Q: Why do algorithmic decision-making systems rely on "proxy" variables?
A: Because the data we want to measure directly is often unavailable or difficult to collect.
